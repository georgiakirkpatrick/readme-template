<!-- PROJECT SHIELDS 
Badges/shields aren't necessary, but using them is a simple way of letting other developers know that you know what you're doing.
Having this section can also be helpful to help link to important tools and also show some simple stats about your project like the number of forks, contributors, open issues etc...
The good thing about this section is that it automatically updates it self.
Don't know where to get them from? Check out the badges hosted by shields.io. They have a ton of badges to help you get started. You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
*** I'm using markdown "reference style" links for readability.
*** Reference links are enclosed in brackets [ ] instead of parentheses ( ).
*** See the bottom of this document for the declaration of the reference variables
*** for contributors-url, forks-url, etc. This is an optional, concise syntax you may use.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT
  This is an important component of your project that many new developers often overlook.

  Your description is an extremely important aspect of your project. A well-crafted description allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers.

  The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:

  - What your application does,
  - Why you used the technologies you used,
  - Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.
-->

## About The Project

Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment set and running.
-->

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES 
Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem – they will always have a place to reference what is expected.

You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.

Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.
